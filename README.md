# IoT-Hyperledger-Development-from-scratch-within-21-days

Industry 4.0 is commonly referred to as the fourth industrial revolution. It is a name given to the current trend of automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies. It includes cyber-physical systems, the Internet of things, cloud computing and cognitive computing.

The challenge is that as awesome Industry 4.0 is, we are in the era of cyber attacks on a daily basis and data leaking.

As you are well aware, sharing data with centralised solutions is a security risk, cost expensive process as you are not synchronised with other parties, trustless as you can't guarantee immutability.

If you need an automated smart factory, context sharing generated by devices or users, process monitoring in private and permission environment, handling time-critical events between parties, be aligned with the regulations etcâ€¦you need a blockchain.

In this series, we will cover every aspect of Hyperledger Fabric development and its core concepts from scratch! We will use Raspberry Pi for our IoT environment to show how to implement an embedded solution which can serve as a guide and concept for further development in Industry 4.0 or any other vertical.
